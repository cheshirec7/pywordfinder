PyWordFinder
============

This is a Python web application that runs on [Google's App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/).

The main goal was to learn about Python and compare performance vs. other development tools.  

This project shows that Python is at a performance disadvantage compared to Google Go and NodeJS.

See the full project description [here](https://github.com/cheshirec7/phpwordfinder).

Uses [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).
